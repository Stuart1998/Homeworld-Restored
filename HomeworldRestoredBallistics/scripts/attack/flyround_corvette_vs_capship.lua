--            -contains flyround attack data
--			   FlyRound heads towards the target ship then plots points on a 
--			   circle and uses these for the flight path. The scripted 
--			   variables govern the orientation of this circle, it's 
--			   resolution and it's radius. FlyRound also occasionaly skips 
--			   segments and you can control that behaviour from this script.
